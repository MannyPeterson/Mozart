## Synopsis

The Mozart Digital Composer project is an attempt at a heuristics based approach, in place of traditional neural networks, for creating computer generated music. The basic principle is to use computer software, in this case a Java SE application, to compose and play, using a MIDI device, music that imitates, as closely as possible, music composed by a Human. The project is currently under active development and many planned features, such as the ability to select the type of scale (e.g major, minor, mixolydian, etc) and key, are in the works.
